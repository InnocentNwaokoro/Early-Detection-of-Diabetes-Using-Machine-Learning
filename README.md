# Project Title
---
## Early Detection of Diabetes Using Machine Learning
---

## Project Overview
---
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of diabetes. 
By analyzing various symptoms and demographic information, the model aims to predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. 
This predictive tool could help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients and take preventive measures early on.

## Key Objectives

- Understand the Data: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in the dataset.
- Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning tasks.
- Feature Selection and Engineering: Identify key features that contribute most to the prediction of diabetes.
- Model Development: Build, train, and evaluate machine learning models using supervised learning algorithms.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
- Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the results

## Dataset Source
This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains clinical features such as age, gender, and various symptoms commonly associated with diabetes.

## Tools
- Python - for data mining, data cleaning, Analysis and visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions
- What is the distribution of the target variable (class)?

- What is the distribution of patientsâ€™ ages?
- Which symptoms are most commonly reported overall?
- How do symptoms differ between Positive and Negative diabetes cases?
